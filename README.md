# Java Classes, Objects, and Methods

## üìò Description
The Java Classes, Objects, and Methods repository provides a foundational understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java. This repository is ideal for developers aiming to learn or reinforce their skills in creating and working with Java classes, objects, and methods. It includes examples, challenges, and practical exercises to help you grasp core OOP concepts.

Key topics covered:

- Classes and Objects: Learn how to define classes and create objects in Java.
- Encapsulation and Methods: Understand method creation, parameter passing, and return values.
- Advanced OOP Features: Explore constructors, method overloading, and object references.
